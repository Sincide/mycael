> [!WARNING]
> I am currently working on a complete overhaul for everything but the shell which should fix most issues with installation.
> As such, I will not be working on the shell until the overhaul is finished. I will still try to answer issues, however other
> than minor issues, I will most likely not be able to fix them (same goes for feature requests). PRs are still welcome though!
> 
> Some breaking changes:
> - Rename the `scripts` repo -> `cli`
> - Rename the `hypr` repo -> `caelestia` (this will be the main repo after the change)
> - Merge all other repos (except this and `cli`) into `caelestia`
> - Installation for the `shell` and `cli` will be done via AUR packages; `caelestia` will have a meta package and an install script (should fix most installation issues)
> - Overhaul the scheme system (should fix a few bugs with that and make it cleaner in general)

caelestia-shell is a feature-rich, customizable desktop shell environment specifically designed for the Hyprland Wayland compositor. Built using QML and the Quickshell framework, it offers a modern and fluid user experience.

## Core Technologies

- **Hyprland:** A dynamic tiling Wayland compositor that `caelestia-shell` is designed to integrate with, providing a modern and fluid window management experience. ([Hyprland Website](https://hyprland.org))
- **Quickshell:** The QML-based framework used to build `caelestia-shell`. It allows for the creation of custom shell components and user interfaces. ([Quickshell Website](https://quickshell.outfoxxed.me))
- **QML (Qt Modeling Language):** A declarative language used for designing user interfaces and defining their behavior. Most of `caelestia-shell`'s UI and logic is written in QML.

## Features

### Bar
Displays an OS icon, customizable workspaces (configurable count, labels, activity indicators, and window previews via popups), active window title, a system tray, clock, status icons (network, Bluetooth, battery) with detailed popout views, and a power button.
- *Configuration: `config/BarConfig.qml`*

### Dashboard
Accessible via a keyboard shortcut, the dashboard presents a user profile picture (sourced from `~/.face`), current weather information, date and time, a calendar, system resource monitors (CPU, RAM, disk usage), and media player controls.
- *Configuration: `config/DashboardConfig.qml`*

### Launcher
A searchable application launcher. It may also include quick actions or wallpaper switching capabilities.
- *Configuration: `config/LauncherConfig.qml`*

### Notifications
A system for displaying notifications from applications and the system itself, ensuring users stay informed about important events.
- *Configuration: `config/NotifsConfig.qml`*

### On-Screen Display (OSD)
Provides visual feedback for various actions, such as volume adjustments, brightness changes, and other system status indicators.
- *Configuration: `config/OsdConfig.qml`*

### Session Management
Manages the user session, including options for locking the screen, logging out, restarting, or shutting down the system.
- *Configuration: `config/SessionConfig.qml`*

### Customizable Appearance
Offers extensive customization options for the shell's visual elements, including global settings for corner rounding, spacing, padding, fonts, and animations. Color schemes can also be defined and applied.
- *Configuration: `config/Appearance.qml`*

## Installation

### Automated installation (recommended)

Install [`caelestia-scripts`](https://github.com/caelestia-dots/scripts) and run `caelestia install shell`.

### Manual installation

Install all [dependencies](https://github.com/caelestia-dots/scripts/blob/main/install/shell.fish#L10), then
clone this repo into `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/quickshell/caelestia`. This directory will also be where you customize the shell (see 'Features' section above for configuration files). Then run `qs -c caelestia` to start the shell.

## Usage

The shell can be started in two ways: via systemd or manually running `caelestia shell`.

### Via systemd

The install script creates and enables the systemd service `caelestia-shell.service` which should automatically start the
shell on login.

### Via command

If not on a system that uses systemd, you can manually start the shell via `caelestia-shell`.
To autostart it on login, you can use an `exec-once` rule in your Hyprland config:
```
exec-once = caelestia shell
```

### Shortcuts/IPC

All keybinds are accessible via Hyprland [global shortcuts](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Binds/#dbus-global-shortcuts).
For a preconfigured setup, install [`caelestia-hypr`](https://github.com/caelestia-dots/hypr) via `caelestia install hypr` or see
[this file](https://github.com/caelestia-dots/hypr/blob/main/hyprland/keybinds.conf#L1-L29) for an example on how to use global
shortcuts.

All IPC commands can be accessed via `caelestia shell ...`. For example
```sh
caelestia shell mpris getActive trackTitle
```

The list of IPC commands can be shown via `caelestia shell help`:
```
> caelestia shell help
target mpris
  function stop(): void
  function play(): void
  function next(): void
  function getActive(prop: string): string
  function list(): string
  function playPause(): void
  function pause(): void
  function previous(): void
target drawers
  function list(): string
  function toggle(drawer: string): void
target wallpaper
  function list(): string
  function get(): string
  function set(path: string): void
target notifs
  function clear(): void
```

### Configuration
`caelestia-shell` is configured by editing QML files located in the `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/quickshell/caelestia/config/` directory. If you installed manually, this is the same directory where you cloned the repository.

Key configuration files include:
- `Appearance.qml`: Controls global theming aspects like rounding, spacing, padding, fonts, and animations. (See "Customizable Appearance" under Features).
- `BarConfig.qml`: Configures the bar, its elements, and behavior. (See "Bar" under Features).
- `DashboardConfig.qml`: Manages the content and layout of the dashboard. (See "Dashboard" under Features).
- `LauncherConfig.qml`: Defines settings for the application launcher. (See "Launcher" under Features).
- `NotifsConfig.qml`: Adjusts notification appearance and behavior. (See "Notifications" under Features).
- `OsdConfig.qml`: Configures the on-screen display elements. (See "On-Screen Display (OSD)" under Features).
- `SessionConfig.qml`: Handles session-related options like logout and lock screen. (See "Session Management" under Features).

Changes to these configuration files typically require a shell reload to take effect. This can usually be done by restarting the `caelestia-shell.service` if using systemd, or by re-running `qs -c caelestia` if you started it manually.

#### Specific Asset Paths
- **Profile Picture (PFP):** The dashboard reads the user's profile picture from `~/.face`. Place your desired image file at this location.
- **Wallpapers:** The wallpaper switcher sources images from `~/Pictures/Wallpapers/`. Store your wallpaper collection in this directory. Currently, the shell needs to be restarted to recognize new wallpapers in this folder. To set the wallpaper via command line, use `caelestia wallpaper set <path_to_image>`.
